‚úÖ Viva Questions with Answers
üî∏ Basics
1. What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud. It allows users to run applications without needing to own physical hardware.

2. What do you mean by ‚ÄúElastic‚Äù in Amazon EC2?
‚ÄúElastic‚Äù means you can easily increase or decrease the number of servers (instances) as per your needs. You can scale your application up or down based on demand.

3. What are the benefits of using EC2 over physical servers?

No need to buy hardware

Pay-as-you-go pricing

Easily scalable

Available worldwide

High availability and reliability

üî∏ Features
4. What is an Elastic IP?
An Elastic IP is a static public IP address that you can assign to an EC2 instance. It remains the same even if the instance is stopped or replaced.

5. What is Auto Scaling and why is it useful?
Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on demand.
It ensures:

High availability during high traffic

Cost savings during low traffic

6. What is the role of an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?
ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure no single server is overloaded, improving application performance and availability.

üî∏ Storage & Backup
7. What is Amazon EBS?
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a storage service that provides persistent block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

8. How is a snapshot in EBS useful?
A snapshot is a backup of your EBS volume stored in Amazon S3. You can restore your data from a snapshot at any time in case of failure.

9. What is Amazon S3 and how does it relate to EC2?
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service used to store and retrieve files. It works with EC2 for:

Backups (like EBS snapshots)

Hosting static website content

Data storage for apps running on EC2

üî∏ Monitoring & Security
10. What is Amazon CloudWatch used for?
CloudWatch is a monitoring tool that tracks metrics such as:

CPU usage

Network traffic

Disk I/O
It helps you understand your EC2 instance‚Äôs performance.

11. What is IAM in AWS?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) allows you to:

Create users, groups, and roles

Assign permissions

Control who can access what in your AWS account

12. How do you manage permissions in AWS?
Permissions are managed using IAM policies. These are JSON-based rules that define what actions users or roles can perform on specific AWS resources.

üî∏ Miscellaneous
13. What is Route 53?
Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) service used to manage domains and route traffic to AWS resources like EC2 or S3.

14. Explain pay-as-you-go pricing in AWS.
You only pay for what you use.
For example:

EC2: pay per hour of usage

S3: pay per GB stored
No upfront costs or long-term contracts required.

15. Can you use your own operating system and software on EC2?
Yes, EC2 supports multiple OS options like Linux, Windows, etc. You can also install any software or programming language you prefer.

üìå FAQ: Apex Programming in Salesforce.com
1. What is Apex in Salesforce?
Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Salesforce to add custom business logic to the Salesforce platform.

2. How is Apex different from Java?
Apex has Java-like syntax but is designed to run on Salesforce‚Äôs multitenant cloud environment. It includes database operations like DML and SOQL as native language features.

Apex code can be written using:

Developer Console

Salesforce UI Code Editor

Force.com IDE (Eclipse-based)

Visual Studio Code with Salesforce Extensions

4. What is a trigger in Apex?
A trigger is Apex code that executes before or after specific database events like insert, update, delete on a Salesforce object.

5. What are SOQL and SOSL in Apex?
SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) is used to retrieve records from a single object or related objects.

SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) is used to search text, email, and phone fields across multiple objects.

6. What are some limitations of Apex?
Cannot modify standard Salesforce functionality.

No support for multithreading.

UI creation is not possible with Apex directly.

Strict governor limits to ensure fair resource usage.

7. What are Governor Limits?
Governor Limits restrict the amount of resources (like CPU time, memory, queries) any single Apex transaction can use to ensure system stability in the multitenant environment.

8. When should I use Apex instead of standard Salesforce tools?
Use Apex when complex business logic, multi-object validation, or real-time automation is needed that cannot be achieved with flows, workflows, or process builders.

9. Can Apex interact with external systems?
Yes, Apex can make callouts to external web services via HTTP requests or by using SOAP/REST APIs.

10. What are DML operations in Apex?
DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations in Apex include:
